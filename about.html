	<p>The Boston Hares are Tracksmith’s Boston racing team. We welcome runners of all abilities, solely asking team members to share in the team’s competitive spirit as we chase personal bests and team championships. </p>
	

    <h2>Performance Standards</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><p>We do not have time standards to join the team. The primary expectation of the team is that your goal is to grow as a runner. We encourage members to regularly seek out opportunities to compete, race, and improve while representing Tracksmith in uniform. Improvement comes in a variety of forms other than running faster, such as trying new distances, attempting to score in a new age division, or challenging yourself following time away from the sport. </p></li>
