	<p>The Boston Hares are Tracksmith’s Boston racing team. We welcome runners of all abilities, solely asking team members to share in the team’s competitive spirit as we chase personal bests and team championships. </p>
	
	<h2>Performance Standards</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><p>We do not have time standards to join the team. The primary expectation of the team is that your goal is to grow as a runner. We encourage members to regularly seek out opportunities to compete, race, and improve while representing Tracksmith in uniform. Improvement comes in a variety of forms other than running faster, such as trying new distances, attempting to score in a new age division, or challenging yourself following time away from the sport. </p></li>

	<h3>Athlete Support Program</h3>
	<p>One of the primary goals of the Boston Hare is to be highly competitive on the New England and national racing circuit. To accomplish this goal, we want to encourage and support team members whose contributions will put us in the position to represent the Hares at the elite level in road racing, track and field, ultra/trail running, and cross-country. The high performance tier supports a limited number of Hares who contribute actively to the team on and off the racing circuit and who’ve demonstrated a high level of racing ability. There are no hard time standards but we are looking for recent (within the last year) high performances (85% age grade minimum) and/or high overall placement at national meets (e.g., USATF XC Nationals). With the high number of athletes on the team that meet these requirements and limited number of support slots, unfortunately, we do not anticipate being able to accept everyone who applies. Thus, the board is placing an emphasis on applicants who are active members on the team (i.e., attend team events) as well as applicants who are committed (or have committed in the past) to running Road/XC USATF NE Grand Prix team races. Accepted athletes will have a board review every quarter (3/1, 6/1, 9/1, 12/1) to ensure a commitment to racing Grand Prix races. The board will also review new applications every quarter and more support slots may become available so we encourage team members to apply.</p>
