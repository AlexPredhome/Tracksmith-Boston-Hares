	<h2>Performance Standards</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><p>We do not have time standards to join the team. The primary expectation of the team is that your goal is to grow as a runner. We encourage members to regularly seek out opportunities to compete, race, and improve while representing Tracksmith in uniform. Improvement comes in a variety of forms other than running faster, such as trying new distances, attempting to score in a new age division, or challenging yourself following time away from the sport. </p></li>
