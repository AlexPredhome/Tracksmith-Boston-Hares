		<p>One of the primary goals of the Boston Hares is to be highly competitive on the New England and national racing circuit. To accomplish this goal, we want to encourage and support team members whose contributions will put us in the position to represent the Hares at the elite level in road racing, track and field, ultra/trail running, and cross-country. 
		</div>
	<div class="list">
	<div class="text">
	<p>The high performance tier supports a limited number of Hares who contribute actively to the team on and off the racing circuit and whoâ€™ve demonstrated a high level of racing ability. There are no hard time standards but we are looking for recent (within the last year) high performances (85% age grade minimum) and/or high overall placement at national meets (e.g., USATF XC Nationals).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text">	
	<p>With the high number of athletes on the team that meet these requirements and limited number of support slots, unfortunately, we do not anticipate being able to accept everyone who applies. Thus, the board is placing an emphasis on applicants who are active members on the team (i.e., attend team events) as well as applicants who are committed (or have committed in the past) to running Road/XC USATF NE Grand Prix team races. Accepted athletes will have a board review every quarter (3/1, 6/1, 9/1, 12/1) to ensure a commitment to racing Grand Prix races.</p> 
	</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="text">	
	<p>The board will also review new applications every quarter and more support slots may become available so we encourage team members to apply.</p>
